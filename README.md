## Session 1: Introduction to Python

**Objective:** To introduce you to Python programming, its basic concepts, and set up your development environment.

### Content:

- **Installing Python and Setting up IDEs:**
  - Learn how to install Python and set up popular IDEs like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and VS Code for an optimal coding environment.

- **Variables, Constants, and Basic Data Types:**
  - Explore examples of defining variables (e.g., `x = 10`) and constants.
  - Understand fundamental data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

- **Operators and Control Flow:**
  - Practice arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators (e.g., `a + b`, `a > b`).
  - Understand conditional statements (`if-else`) and loops (`for`, `while`) to control program flow.
  
  - **Example:** Write a program to calculate the sum of even numbers in a given range.

- **Basic Data Structures:**
  - Introduction to lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
  - Learn list comprehensions.

- **Python Functions:**
  - Learn to write reusable Python functions.
  - Explore lambda functions for simple operations.
  
  - **Example:** Create a function that checks if a number is prime.
  - **Example:** Use a lambda function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

- **Exception Handling:**
  - Learn to handle errors gracefully using `try-except` blocks.

  - **Example:** Build a calculator program that catches invalid inputs (e.g., dividing by zero).

## Session 2: Data Analysis Using Pandas

**Objective:** To learn how to analyze and manipulate data using the powerful Pandas library.

### Content:

- **Introduction to Pandas:**
  - Understand the basics of Series and DataFrames, the core structures in Pandas.
  - Learn how to import datasets and manipulate them using Pandas.

  - **Example:** Load a CSV file of sales data and filter rows where sales exceed a specific value.

- **Advanced Analytics with Pandas:**
  - Perform group-by operations, pivot tables, and aggregations to summarize data.

  - **Example:** Analyze a dataset to calculate monthly sales averages by region.

- **Time Series Manipulation:**
  - Learn how to handle date-time data, resample data, and perform rolling operations.

  - **Example:** Resample stock price data to calculate monthly averages.

## Session 3: Data Visualization Using Python

**Objective:** To master data visualization techniques using various Python libraries.

### Content:

- **Introduction to Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn:**
  - Create static visualizations such as line charts, bar plots, and scatter plots.
  - Learn to customize plots for effective storytelling.

  - **Example:** Visualize the trend of sales data over a year with a line chart.

- **Overview of Plotly:**
  - Explore interactive plotting capabilities and create dynamic charts.

  - **Example:** Create an interactive scatter plot to display customer segmentation.

- **Basics of Dash for Interactive Visualizations:**
  - Learn to build web-based dashboards using Dash for presenting data interactively.

  - **Example:** Develop a sales dashboard with filters for regions and timeframes.
